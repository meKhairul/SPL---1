Title:    Computerized Adaptive Test System


Project Description:  The program will consist of a user interface and a backend
which contains some specific set of questions on one topic or various topics.
Depending on the user’s performance at answering, the program will evaluate the
user and change the question set according to the user’s skill. Here the questions
set will be selected by implementing a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT)
algorithm (Both Rasch Algorithm and Monte Carlo Algorithm). Finally the
grade/performance of the user will be displayed.

Feedback during Mid Presentation  :

1. answers to be randomize
2. Negative marking
3. question skiping
